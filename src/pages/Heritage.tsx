            Coconut Oil in Indian Culture
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Long before modern science validated its benefits, ancient Indian civilizations recognized coconut oil 
              as a divine gift. Sanskrit texts dating back thousands of years describe the coconut palm as 
              "Kalpa Vriksha"‚Äîthe tree that fulfills all wishes‚Äîand its oil as liquid prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the coastal regions of Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, coconut oil isn't just an ingredient‚Äîit's 
              an integral part of daily life. From the first oil massage a newborn receives to the sacred lamps 
              lit during festivals, coconut oil marks every important milestone and celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita extensively document coconut 
              oil's therapeutic properties. Ancient physicians prescribed it for everything from digestive health to 
              skin ailments, recognizing properties that modern research is only now beginning to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The traditional method of extracting coconut oil‚Äîthe same method we use at Panshashree‚Äîwas developed 
              through centuries of refinement. Our ancestors understood that patience and purity produce superior 
              quality, a wisdom that industrial methods have forgotten but we proudly preserve.

                The Karavali Coast: Where Tradition Meets Quality
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                  The Karavali coastal region of Mangaluru, in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka, is blessed with 
                  perfect conditions for coconut cultivation. The tropical coastal climate, laterite-rich red soil, and 
                  abundant monsoon rainfall create an environment where coconut palms thrive with exceptional oil content 
                  and nutritional density.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Panchashree's oil comes from traditional family groves in Mundaje, Belthangady, and surrounding areas 
                  where coconut cultivation is not just agriculture‚Äîit's a heritage. These farmers don't just grow coconuts; 
                  they nurture each tree, understanding its rhythms and needs through generations of intimate knowledge passed 
                  down through families.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The specific varieties of coconuts grown in our Karavali region‚Äîadapted over centuries to the coastal 
                  microclimate‚Äîproduce coconuts with higher oil content and richer nutritional profiles. Each variety 
                  contributes unique characteristics to our oil's authentic flavor, golden color, and health benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The combination of sea breeze, mineral-rich laterite soil, and traditional sustainable farming methods 
                  creates coconuts that are simply superior in quality. When you choose Panchashree, you're experiencing 
                  the essence of coastal Karnataka's agricultural heritage, captured in every golden drop.

                  In traditional Hindu households, the day begins by lighting a lamp with pure coconut oil. 
                  This simple ritual, performed for thousands of years, symbolizes the triumph of knowledge 
                  over ignorance, light over darkness. The lamp fueled by coconut oil burns steady and bright, 
                  just as Panshashree keeps the flame of tradition alive in modern times.
